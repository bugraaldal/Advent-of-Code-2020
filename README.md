# Final Thoughts
I didn't want to participate in this. I was afraid of my skills being not able to cut it. Then my friend on the Python Discord joined, which encouraged me to do the same. He had to leave after a while -around the 10th day- because his finals week was coming up. However, I kept continuing. I had a taste of this kind of problems due to my Codeforces background. You never know before trying afterall. My least favorite was day 13 because of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. I wouldn't be able to solve it without the theorem since the actual input was too long to run in my original code. I learnt about the the theorem from the Python server. All and all it was a fun journey and a great way to say "Merry Christmas" in a coder way. I definetely learned a thing or two. But most importantly I learnt to trust myself regardless of the challange ahead. I needed this.
My stats at the time I'm writing this:
55th on the Python Discord General Leaderboard
10th on the Python Discord Private Leaderboard
4th on the Tech with Tim Discord Leaderboard
